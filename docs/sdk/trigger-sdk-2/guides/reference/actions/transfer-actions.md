# Transfer Actions

Transfer Actions are used to send native tokens (like AVAX, ETH, CELO) between addresses. They're the simplest type of action in the SDK, perfect for basic token transfers.

## Example

```typescript
const transferAction: Metadata = {
  url: 'https://myapp.example',
  icon: 'https://example.com/icon.png',
  title: 'Send AVAX',
  description: 'Quick AVAX transfer',
  actions: [
    {
      type: 'transfer',
      label: 'Send 0.1 AVAX',
      to: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
      amount: 0.1,
      chains: { source: 'avalanche' },
    },
  ],
};
```
