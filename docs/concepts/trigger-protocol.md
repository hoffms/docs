# The Trigger Protocol

## Introduction

In the context of the Sherry ecosystem and Web3 development, "triggers" refer to modular, metadata-defined actions or mini-applications (Trigger dApps) that users can activate or interact with, typically embedded within social media feeds or Web3 interfaces. These triggers enable users to perform blockchain-related operations—such as staking, minting NFTs, token transfers, or accessing gated content—through simple, interactive elements that "trigger" on-chain transactions or workflows.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Triggers are interactive building blocks defined by metadata that specify the logic and flow of blockchain actions
- **No-Code Development**: Designed to be easily created, shared, and executed without requiring users to write smart contract code
- **Composable**: Triggers can be combined or nested to form complex multi-step actions
- **Social Integration**: Rendered and activated via UI components (like those in TriggerKit or ggKit) and can be accessed through social media integrations
- **Multi-Chain Support**: The Sherry Minithon event emphasizes creating triggers as user-friendly, trustable on-chain interactions usable across multiple blockchains like Avalanche and Base2

## Protocol Components

### Development Tools

- **TriggerSDK**: The TriggerSDK is an npm package designed to create metadata for Trigger dApps. It helps define the structure and configuration of apps through metadata files.
- **Debugger**: A tool to debug Trigger dApps metadata, allowing developers to inspect and troubleshoot the metadata that defines app behavior.
- **Chat**: An AI-powered chat interface that assists in creating Trigger dApps, providing conversational guidance and code generation.

### Infrastructure

- **Nucleo**: A middleware tool responsible for sanitizing requests to the directory, ensuring security and integrity of app requests.
- **Directory**: The hosting environment for ggApps. It manages app deployment and availability.
- **MCP**: A server infrastructure that supports app creation through Chat, providing backend services necessary for the chat-based app development workflow.

### Integration & Deployment

- **TriggerKit**: A collection of UI components that render ggApps based on the metadata generated by ggMetadata. It provides the visual and interactive elements for the apps.
- **Templates**: Pre-built Trigger dApps with certified actions that can be used as starting points.
- **Community Repository**: A public repository of published Trigger dApps that users can remix and customize.
- **Browser Extension**: A browser extension that renders the Trigger dApps directly on social media feeds like X, enabling seamless integration and user interaction with Trigger Apps in real-time environments.
