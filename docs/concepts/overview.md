## Introduction

Sherry is a Web3 developer ecosystem and platform designed to make Trigger dApps — modular, metadata-defined actions or mini-applications — easy to create, deploy, and use directly within social media feeds.

## Why Sherry?
Imagine interacting with blockchain-powered apps seamlessly while scrolling through your favorite social networks like X, without needing complicated wallets or smart contract knowledge. Sherry's mission is to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and everyday social interactions. 

## Triggers, Studio, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Sherry", some of which may confuse new users.

- [Sherry Labs](https://sherry.social/): The company which developed the Trigger Protocol, along with the web interface.
- [Trigger Protocol](https://github.com/SherryLabs/sherry-sdk): Comprehensive developer toolkit and infrastructure for creating, deploying, and interacting with Trigger dApps — specialized interactive mini-applications designed primarily for social media feeds and Web3 environments. 
- Sherry Studio (TBA): Your platform for creating Triggers. It offers tools for developers like the Debugger, low code solutions for beginners and community projects to Remix. It is also where you get your Trigger App verified for publishing.  
- Sherry Marketplace (TBA): A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Sherry Apps. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Sherry Apps.
- Sherry Extension (TBA): An extension that allow users to interact with Triggers directly inside social media posts
