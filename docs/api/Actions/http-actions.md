# HTTP Actions

> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

> This documentation is currently under development. HTTP Actions will enable direct interaction with web services and APIs through the Sherry Protocol.
>
> Check back soon for complete documentation including:
> - Interface definition
> - Authentication methods
> - Request/response handling
> - Error management
> - Example implementations
> - Best practices

> For now, you can use HTTP Actions within [Nested Action Flows](./nested-action-flows) for basic HTTP requests.

## Coming Soon

The HTTP Actions API will provide a powerful way to:
- Make authenticated API calls
- Process web service responses
- Handle complex HTTP workflows
- Integrate with external services
- Manage API keys securely

Stay tuned for updates!
