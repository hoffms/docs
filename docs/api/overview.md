# Sherry API Documentation

Welcome to the Sherry API documentation. This section provides information about the various APIs available for interacting with the Trigger Protocol.

## Available APIs

### Actions API
Sherry provides a powerful Actions API that enables developers to create and interact with Trigger dApps. The API supports four types of actions:

- **Dynamic Actions**: For complex server-side logic like DeFi strategies, dynamic pricing, and cross-chain operations
- **Blockchain Actions**: For direct smart contract interactions like token transfers, NFT minting, and DAO voting
- **Transfer Actions**: For simple native token transfers (ETH, AVAX, CELO) with customizable UI
- **Flow Actions**: For creating multi-step workflows with conditional branching

Each action type is designed for specific use cases and can be configured through metadata. The Actions API supports both single-chain and cross-chain operations across supported networks including Avalanche, Celo, and Ethereum.
