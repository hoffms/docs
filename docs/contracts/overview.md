# Sherry Smart Contracts

Welcome to the Sherry smart contracts documentation. This section provides comprehensive documentation for Sherry's smart contract system, which powers the Trigger Protocol.

## Overview

Sherry's smart contracts enable the creation and execution of Trigger dApps - modular, metadata-defined actions that can be deployed and used directly within social media feeds. The contract system is designed to be:

- **Modular**: Each contract has a specific purpose and can be composed with others
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized for cost-effective execution on multiple chains
- **Secure**: Built with security best practices and extensive testing
- **Cross-Chain**: Supports operations across multiple blockchain networks

## Documentation Structure

## Core Components

### Trigger Protocol
The foundation of Sherry's contract system, enabling:
- Creation and management of Trigger dApps
- Execution of on-chain actions
- Cross-chain operations
- Metadata management

### Action Contracts
Specialized contracts for different types of actions:
- **Dynamic Actions**: For complex server-side logic
- **Blockchain Actions**: For direct smart contract interactions
- **Transfer Actions**: For native token transfers
- **Flow Actions**: For multi-step workflows

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Learn how to [set up your development environment](./guides/getting-started)
2. **Deployment**: Follow our [deployment guide](./guides/deployment)
3. **Integration**: See how to [integrate with your dApp](./guides/integration)

## Contract Addresses

| Network | Contract | Address |
